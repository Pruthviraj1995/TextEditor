Through the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning, our software uses your webcam and microphone to capture your answers and analyze hireable soft skills. Using this approach, we want to provide you with the agency and opportunity to better represent yourself early in the hiring cycle.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Ready to do the assessment?</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is not a live interview, it is a timed video assessment. Therefore, you may dress in comfortable attire as only the software will be viewing and analyzing your videos.</span></li>\n<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Find yourself a quiet place to speak into your webcam and microphone, using either the Chrome or Firefox browser and follow the prompts (see technical requirements below). We recommend you use either a desktop or a laptop to complete the interview.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Please click the button below to start your video assessment. </span><strong>Please note that clicking this button will NOT begin the assessment process &mdash; you will have the opportunity to choose a practice run and become acquainted with the technology beforehand.</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>`;
